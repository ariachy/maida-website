    "rootsText2": "When we arrived in Lisbon, we discovered something familiar: the Portuguese share this same love for gathering around a big table and turning a meal into an occasion. It felt like home.",
    "rootsText3": "That's how two worlds became one. Maída is a Mediterranean restaurant with Lebanese soul in the heart of Cais do Sodré - where Portuguese warmth meets Lebanese generosity, celebrating what both cultures share: the belief that food is meant to bring people together.",
